# Cernify

### Content that doesn't suck.

</div>

This is the main monorepo codebase of [Cernify](https://cernify.com).

## What is Cernify?

### Vision

Cernify brings together professionals and the public to discover, share, and build content that doesn't suck. Through sharing, communication, and collaboration we can make finding valuable content suck less.

## Contributing

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match will match our coming roadmap and engineering standards!**

That being said, this codebase isn't a typical open source project. It's not a library or package with a limited scope, it's the entire Cernify product.
